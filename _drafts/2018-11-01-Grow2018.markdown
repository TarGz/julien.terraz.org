I've been commissioned to create an interactive installation at Grow 2018, the only constraint was the space available, a wall have been assigned to me and I could create whatever “interactive thing” I wanted. So I immediately tough that it will be the best occasion to use my Billund Mono Sans bricks and create something interactive with it. I wanted to do so for a while and I was specially interested by how attendees will appropriate the installation. 

From Nov 12 to 16 @ Halle Événementielle, Ground Control

        <h2>Insigth</h2>
        <p>Conference like grow are really inspiring, I’ve been attended a bunch and every-time I felt really inspired and boosted to create things. The speakers lineup  for this year was really promising so people will be inspired.</p>
      <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>Create some blank canvas where people could express their inspiration and set them in stone before going back to everyday life where inspiration kind of fade out.</p>
    </div>
</div>




## INSPIRED?
Inspired? is a triptych of canvas composed of lines where attendees could snap letter bricks on. Lines are a bias a choose to influence user to actually write sentence. Each canvas have a repository of bricks of different colors Orange and Black, Pink and Purple and Green and Black.

## Did it worked ?
Yes people immediately start using it… but not as expected, people did not write sentence, they mostly used it to write name and hashtag sort of things… I was a bit disappointed and I’m pretty sure now that the fact that it was pretty hard to find letter in the repository was one aspect of that.

## Takeout ?

I was a bit disappointed until someone did something I wasn't expecting, he used the brick as shapes instead as letters…
