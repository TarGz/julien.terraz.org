Juke Power-up, the infectious new web app that’s just landed on Google Android. Unleash your energy to power up your phone, and see your score once you can’t give it anymore. Got more muscle than your mates?

We had the first ever mobile FWA for a Flash website, and yes back in the day that was cool :-)
