### THE BRIEF 

> Could you both generate traffic on Dior corner shop and have some good PR around innovations ? 

The best option for us was VR and a custom card board sounded like the best option. But as it was Dior we had to push it further they wanted a glowing Dior logo, we wanted to had 3D sound to the experience and we had only 4 month to ship 12 headset around the world.

### HOW WE DID IT

This project was perfect for a Labs process how we do it usualy, we had 4 main problematics:

- Power management
- Logo Back ligthning
- Lens and image quality
- 3D printing material quality and surface finish

 Each one could have an impact on each other. This lead us to solve them in paralel in a iterative way.

### RUSH

After the R&D process you endup with a working prototype that feet all the requirements, but as usual your are a bit late on the planning, that were the rush start... and you know you are in trouble when your desk looks like this, it's a bit like having code not well organized.
